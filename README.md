# Junction Temperature Estimation from Switching Waveforms

During my PhD at the [IMB-CNM (CSIC)](https://www.imb-cnm.csic.es/en) in Barcelona I was in charge (among other things) of developing postprocessing software to convert measured electrical waveforms of a device under test (operating inside the resonant converter setup) to junction temperature. This repository has all the MATLAB scripts and functions needed to do so.

---

## **Overview**
The workflow:
1. Import measured waveforms (`Vce`, `Ic`, `Vge`) from CSV files acquired with the TiePie setup.
2. Generate processing mask for switching periods.
3. Apply corrections:
   - Offset correction for `Vce`
   - Inductive drop compensation
5. Estimate junction temperature using a lookup table (LUT) and thermal impedance.
6. Compute uncertainty propagation and statistical analysis.

## **Requirements**
- MATLAB (works on R2024a)
- Look up table properly formatted `.mat` files for the specific device under test

## **How to Use**
### **Single File Processing**
Run:
```matlab
main_script
```
- Select two CSV files: one with `time, Vce, Ic` and another with `Vge`.
- Outputs:
  - Full Tj and uncertainty waveform during processing window.
  - Period-wise analysis of Tj during processing window.
  - Period-wise analysis of Tj at the point of maximum Ic.

### **Bulk Processing**
Run:
```matlab
bulk_processing
```
- Select multiple CSV files (pairs of waveform and Vge files).
- Outputs:
  - Period-wise analysis of Tj at the point of maximum Ic only.
